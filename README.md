## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The plugin is highly configurable through the `config.yml` file. Here are the key configuration options:

```yaml
# Database configuration

  # Type: mysql or sqlite
  type: sqlite
  mysql:
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    database: sovereignty
    username: root
    password: password
    use-ssl: false

# Language setting (defaults to en_US)

  max-claims:
    level-1: 20
    level-2: 40
    level-3: 80
    level-4: 160
    level-5: 320

  # Duration after which wars automatically end in a draw (in hours)

```

## üîÑ Power System

Nations progress through six power levels that determine their capabilities and territorial limits:

1. **Tribal Civilization** - Small, isolated communities with minimal trade or alliances
2. **Developing Nation** - Basic trade and alliances forming
3. **Emerging Power** - Moderate population with occasional trade and few alliances
4. **Urbanized Nation** - Large population, frequent trades, several alliances
5. **Regional Power** - Dominates land, trades well, multiple allies
6. **Global Superpower** - Massive playerbase with strong global influence

Power grows through:

- Nation population growth
- Forming alliances
- Successful trade relations
- War victories

## üóÑÔ∏è MySQL Setup

While Sovereignty works with SQLite by default, for larger servers MySQL is recommended:

1. **Create a MySQL Database**:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE sovereignty;
   CREATE USER 'sovereignty'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sovereignty.* TO 'sovereignty'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

2. **Configure the Plugin**:
   Update your `config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   database:
     type: mysql
     mysql:
       host: localhost
       port: 3306
       database: sovereignty
       username: sovereignty
       password: yourpassword
       use-ssl: false
   ```

3. **Restart Your Server**:
   The plugin will automatically create the necessary tables.
